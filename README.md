# Performance Metrics and Win Rate in 2022 ATP (Menâ€™s Tennis) Season 
This project is a part of the poster project for QTM 302W at Emory University in fall 2022.

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to investigate the impact on win rates of different performance indicators for professional men's tennis players.

### Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* Data cleaning
* Linear regression

### Technologies
* Python

## Project Description
-Used dataset containing statistics of top 50 players in the ATP (men's tennis circuit) in the 2022 season.
-Looked at 6 different variables indicating a player's performance in serving and returning.
-Used data visualization techniques such as scatterplots to get an initial idea of what each of the variable's relationship with win rate is.
-Ran 3 linear regression models to look at the differences in how serving and returning performance can explain win rate of a player.
-The most challenging part of the project is combining different datasets, which was done manually via Excel to produce the most optimal results.
-Potential next steps are to investigate more performance metrics as well as compare the most decent data to historical data of previous seasons. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
